# Garrett-Holtz-s-Academic-Coding-Projects
This is a list of my coding projects throughout my years at Kettering. Most of these projects do not have the original requirements that these fulfill.
My most up to date code is under the CS231 branch which is coded in C everything else is Java.

Click the dropdown currently labeled main to see the other courses and programs that correspond to said courses. Click on the name of the course to "enter" it and then you may click on any of the programs to view the code (They will not run on your machine through github). All programs are currently labled Prog (Program) with a number following it representing the order in which the programs were completed.
